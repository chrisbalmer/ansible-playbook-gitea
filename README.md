# Gitea Playbook

This playbook deploys Gitea onto a CentOS/RHEL based system using docker containers. The storage backend used is NFS.

You will need to remove the example host data and replace it with your own. This was tested on a CentOS image from my packer-el7 packer repository.

More details to be added at a later date.
